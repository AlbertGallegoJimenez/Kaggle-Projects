# Kaggle Projects Repository

Welcome to my Kaggle Projects repository, where I store my personal solutions as part of my learning journey in data science and machine learning.

## Repository Purpose

This repository serves as a record of my personal challenges on Kaggle, where I tackle different datasets and problems to enhance my skills in data analysis, predictive modeling, and other areas related to data science.

## Current Projects

Here's a list of projects I have tackled to date (📊 and 🤖 denote whether the project contains Statistical Analysis and/or Modeling, respectively):

1. 🐲[Pokémon](1_Pokemon) - 📊: Explored a Pokémon dataset, conducting in-depth statistical and visual analysis to unveil patterns and quirks in their characteristics.

2. 🛳️[Titanic](2_Titanic) - 🤖: Developed a binary classification model of the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival of the shipwreck.

4. 🏘️[Housing Price Prediction](3_Housing%20prices) - 📊🤖: Developed a regression model to predict housing prices based on various features.

5. 🎥[IMDb movies](4_IMDb%20movies) - 📊: Explored an IMDb movies dataset, conducting a comprehensive data pre-processing and an in-depth statistical analysis to find valuable patterns.
